Solidity:
---------

1. Object oriented programming language for smartcontracts 
2. Curly-bracket language
3. Designed for Ethereum virtual machine(EVM)
4. Statically typed (variable must be specified)
5. supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types

**SmartContracts are programs that govern behaviour of accounts within Ethereum state

2. uint = positive => default value =0
3. address = ethereum address => default value = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
4. string = can use both "" '' 
5. bytes = alternative to string. less gas price => default value =0x
6. boolean =true or false => default value false.

Functions:
---------

    Functions are the executable units of code. Functions are usually defined inside a contract, but they can also be defined outside of contracts.

syntax:
    function functionName(argument) visibility state mutability returns (datatype){
    }
